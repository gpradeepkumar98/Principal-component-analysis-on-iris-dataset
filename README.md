# Principal-component-analysis-on-iris-dataset

This repository contains a Python script and Jupyter Notebook demonstrating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the famous Iris dataset. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in data analysis and machine learning to reduce the number of features while preserving as much variance as possible. In this project, we apply PCA to the Iris dataset to visualize and understand the data better.

Introduction

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, containing measurements of 150 iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. PCA is used in this project to reduce these four dimensions into a smaller number of dimensions while preserving the most important information in the data.
Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following Python libraries:

    NumPy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    Matplotlib
    Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter

Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/gpradeepkumar98/Principal-component-analysis-on-iris-dataset

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

    cd pca-iris-dataset

    Open the Jupyter Notebook (PCA.ipynb) in your preferred environment or editor.

Usage

In the Jupyter Notebook, you will find step-by-step instructions on how to perform PCA on the Iris dataset. The notebook includes code snippets and explanations to help you understand each part of the process. You can run the code cells interactively in the notebook.

To run the provided Python script instead of the notebook, you can execute the following command in your terminal:

bash

python pca_iris.py

This will generate PCA plots and explain the variance explained by each principal component.
Results

After running the code in the notebook or the Python script, you will obtain visualizations and insights into the Iris dataset after applying PCA. These results include:

    PCA scatter plots to visualize the data in the reduced-dimensional space.
    Explained variance ratios for each principal component.

You can use these results to better understand the structure and relationships within the Iris dataset, which can be valuable for various data analysis and machine learning tasks.
